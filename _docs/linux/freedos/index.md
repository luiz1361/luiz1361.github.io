I was struggling with BIOS upgrades for our new Dell servers, as Dell didnâ€™t provide bootable ISO image for BIOS upgrades.
After searching for DOS bootable images I have found FreeDOS project.
Unfortunately FreeDOS 1.1 LiveCD mode is not supported out of the box.
Using modified iso image from this page you can boot directly to DOS without need to install anything:

To add your own files to the iso, just use trial version of Magic ISO Maker (300MB maximum), or some similar program.
Just put your custom files in FREEDOS folder and after booting you will be able to run them in DOS environment.
After boot process is complete run dir command to see what files are in current directory.
