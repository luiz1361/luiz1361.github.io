## Draft

* Deliver work sooner than later, even if rework is required. Focus on delivering results for the business.
* User stories: Who, What and Why
* Make user stories small, if more than a few days split
* Daily stand up meeting: face to face, quick, solve conflicts, did/doing/will do next
* Agile team only if: deliver usable code regular basis and welcome changes.
* Transparent: end of sprint, or 1-2weeks, demoing working software, staging, user testing, help with incorrect assumptions, transparency over polishing.
* Agile isn't a methodology, as it needs to adapt. So it helps you choose what methodology you should use based on principals and values.
* SCRUM is a methodology which dictates: standup meetings, sprints, retrospective, etc.

## 12 Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
* Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Values

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
* Working software over comprehensive documentation.
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
* Responding to change over following a plan.
